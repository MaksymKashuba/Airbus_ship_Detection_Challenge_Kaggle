## Airbus Ship Detection Challenge

### Project Overview
This project addresses the Airbus Ship Detection Challenge by leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect ships in satellite images. The primary focus lies in image processing, object detection, and segmentation, utilizing advanced neural network architectures.

### Components
- **Python Files**: 
  - `inference.py`: For generating predictions.
  - `train.py`: Contains functions for training a deep learning model, likely a U-Net architecture, with data augmentation and upsampling techniques.
  - `utils.py`: Includes utilities like decoding run-length encoded masks, indicating a focus on image segmentation, and custom loss metrics.
  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: 
  - `analysis.ipynb`: Used for data analysis and model evaluation.
  - `test.ipynb`: For testing the model with TensorFlow and OpenCV.

### Dependencies
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Handling**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, Scikit-Image
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib

### Usage
Include instructions for setting up the environment, running the training process, and executing the analysis and testing notebooks.

### Additional Notes
Further documentation, particularly in `inference.py` and `train.py`, is recommended to enhance clarity and understanding.
